# Genetic Algorithm Starter Kit

**A Crayon's Data Insights Knowledge Pill**

The notebook `./genetic_algorithm.ipynb` briefly introduces an implementation of a genetic algorithm by example and showcases how to solve sudokus using this approach. All other available resources found in this repo are simply for providing functionalities used in the notebook.

This repo has been created exclusively for a knowledge exchange within the Data Insights Team of [Crayon](https://www.crayon.com/at/).
